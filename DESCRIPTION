Description: Computing point effect size estimates from the d family (when comparing two means) and confidence intervals around them,
    as well as raw mean differences and confidence intervals around them. Regarding the d family, we compute only  unbiased estimates, 
    i.e. Hedges' gs, Shieh's gs, Hedges' g's and Glass's gs (for more details about these unbiased effect size estimators, 
    see https://github.com/mdelacre/Effect-sizes).
