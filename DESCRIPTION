Description: Computing point effect size estimates from the d family (when comparing two means) and confidence intervals around them.
	we compute only  unbiased estimates, i.e. Hedges' gs, Shieh's gs, Hedges' g's and Glass's gs (for more details about these unbiased
	 effect size estimators, see https://github.com/mdelacre/Effect-sizes)
